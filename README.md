# Github action WordPress.org `readme.txt` update

With this GitHub action you can easily update your WordPress plugin `readme.txt` file in the WordPress plugin directory.

## Introduction

### Streamline Your WordPress Plugin Updates

This GitHub action simplifies updating your WordPress plugin's readme.txt file directly in the WordPress plugin directory.

### Focus on What Matters

Unlike the popular `10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update` GitHub action, this action targets a specific need: keeping your `readme.txt` up-to-date. This streamlined approach avoids unnecessary complexity.

### Built for WordPress Developers

Leveraging PHP instead of bash scripting, this action caters to the preferences of many WordPress developers, offering a familiar and potentially more convenient workflow.
